# IPL-Auction-Buys

## Description
A website built for IPL teams to keep track of the players they've bought. This was built as part of GDSC's 2 day Javascript workshop.

## Installation steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sikehish/IPL-Auction-Buys.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd IPL-Auction-Buys
    ```

3. Choose the branch you want to work with:
    ```bash
    git checkout branch-name
    ```
    Replace `branch-name` with the name of the branch you want to check out, such as `1-starter` or `main`.

4. Run a development server:
   
   - **Using Live Server (Visual Studio Code extension)**:
     - If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Live Server extension.
     - Right-click on the `index.html` file in the project directory and select "Open with Live Server".
   
   - **Using Python's built-in HTTP server**:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```
     This will start a development server hosting your project. You can then access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000` or a similar address provided by the server.
   
   - **Using Node.js's http-server package** (if Node.js is installed):
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server
     ```
     This will start a development server hosting your project. You can then access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` or a similar address provided by the server.
